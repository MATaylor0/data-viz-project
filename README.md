# data-viz-project

### Data Visualisation Project
The aim of this project is to create an interactive world map that shows how economic factors have changed over time across the world.

### Technologies Used
The main technology for the visualisation will be D3.js & Leaflet.js. Using these two libraries we will deliver a data visualisation that displays a map with elements that are able to change colour depending on the underlying data.

### Data sources
